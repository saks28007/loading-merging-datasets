# EXP 1: Loading and Merging Datasets from the UCIML Repository.
This repository includes the code and results for the first experiment in the Introduction to Data Science with Python course. It focuses on loading, cleaning, and merging datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, covering key data preparation steps and simple visualizations for analysis.

# Experiment Overview
# Steps:
1. Loading Data : Datasets are imported using the Pandas library from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Exploring Data : A quick preview of the first few rows of each dataset is displayed to grasp their structure and content.
3. Combining Data : Datasets are merged based on a shared column (such as 'ID') to create a unified dataset.
4. Exporting Data : The combined dataset is optionally saved to a CSV file for further use or analysis.
